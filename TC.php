                Our Sri Lanka experts inspect every property and facility regularly to ensure that the contents of this web site are accurate. However, circumstances can change after publication. For example, all the facilities in a resort might not be fully functional in early or late season. A pool may be closed for maintenance, or air conditioning may only be available at certain times of the day and/or year. Public holidays and religious festivals may also affect the availability of resort and hotel facilities. <br> 
                We will tell you of any changes that we know about when you book your accommodation. </p>
                            
                <p class = "para"> <strong> Excursions </strong> <br> 
                We expressly reserve the right to prevent you from participating in the excursions we provide, if in the reasonable opinion of our staff or those of the excursion provider, you are either unsuited to undertake the excursion, or if you appear to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. In these circumstances your sole remedy against us will be to obtain a refund of the cost of that excursion. </p>
